# Project 2
The idea for my project two is something along the lines of a online picture forum, or something along those lines utilizing the cloudinary api, pushing myself to go above and beyond in creating a user involved space, where individuals can create and post their own content, as well as view other posts from users with the capability of commenting and interacting. 

# User Stories
As a User, I would like to be able to share pictures of my loved ones, animals or moments in time with other people on the internet.
As a User, I would like to be able to create an account and manage my posts.
As a User, I would like to be able to see other users posts, as well as being able to comment and interact with them.

# MVP Goals
MVP for this website would be, safe user creation and obfusication of personal info. Capability to store user information in a database away from the users eye. Ability to upload pictures, store pictures, comment on pictures, and interaction with other users.

# Stretch Goals
Some major stretch goals would be a friends list for the users. The ability to have a private messaging system from one user to another. Make the layout of the website intuitive and create a nice user experience. Continuous improvements and functionality are generally what's on the horizon.
